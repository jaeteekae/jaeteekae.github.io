    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Julia Knight, and I am a sophomore studying computer science for my undergraduate degree at Tufts University. I am also considering a minor in pure mathematics. I have around 3 years of experience programming. My goal for my time at Tufts is to become as well rounded a programmer as possible by taking web, math, etc. classes to supplement the core requirements for the CS degree.
